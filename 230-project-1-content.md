## Hark! The Markup Lingers: College Student Suffers

### by Elijah Berk-Silverman

<article>

### Overview

Homework is hard. We all know it. The main character of our story is a college student who gets so frustrated by his web design homework that he decides to screw it and go to sleep. But web design continues to haunt his mind...and he encounters a dreamworld where he has to conquer it through turn-based combat in order to escape.

### Genre

The game is a turn-based RPG, of the Final Fantasy and Pokemon variety. The combat won't work exactly the same, but it's a very similar system.

### Hook

It's an intriguing twist on a classic genre- especially for us college students, who might relate to this game in a huge way. It will create an interesting dreamworld and delve into some of the web design basics.

### Game World

The main character is currently unnamed. He has to explore his dreamworld and conquer his web design nightmares in order to finish his homework on time.

### Technology Highlights

The game will be a browser game made with Javascript. The sound will be composed entirely by me. Graphics are cartoon-style- probably outsourced to a better artist. The game is played in web browsers with mouse and keyboard controls.

## Documentation

In designing this webpage, my main references used were either the W3schools website, which has many helpful tips and tricks, or any class exercises that we've done. The exercises heloped me with mobile design and designing the navbar, while W3schools helped me with various minor questions I had about HTML tags or CSS properties. I combined these two sources to finish this design.
